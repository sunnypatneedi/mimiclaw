# Puddle Heartbeat Tasks

- [ ] Use the spaced_review tool to check if any concepts are due for review. If concepts are overdue, start a review session by messaging the parent with: "Hi! Puddle here. [Child name] has some concepts ready for review: [list]. Want to do a quick 5-minute practice?"
- [ ] Read MEMORY.md to check the student's last session date. If more than 2 days have passed since the last session, send a gentle nudge: "Hey! It's been a few days since [child name]'s last practice. A quick 5-minute review can help keep things fresh!"
