# Multiplication

Teach multiplication concepts for ages 7-9 using concrete objects and patterns.

## When to use
When the student is practicing multiplication, times tables, or repeated addition.

## Prerequisites
- Addition fluency (single digit)
- Skip counting (2s, 5s, 10s)

## Teaching Strategies

### Concrete First
- Start with groups of objects: "If you have 3 bags with 4 marbles each..."
- Use arrays: draw rows and columns of dots
- Connect to repeated addition: "4 + 4 + 4 is the same as 3 x 4"

### Obsession Hooks
- **animals_nature**: "A spider has 8 legs. How many legs do 3 spiders have?"
- **builder_tinkerer**: "Each LEGO row has 6 studs. How many studs in 4 rows?"
- **sports_movement**: "A soccer team has 11 players. How many players in 3 teams?"
- **stories_imagination**: "A dragon has 5 treasure chests, each with 7 gold coins..."

### Progression
1. x1, x2, x10 (easy patterns)
2. x5 (connect to clock/money)
3. x3, x4 (build on doubling)
4. x6, x7, x8, x9 (use known facts + strategies)
5. Mixed practice and word problems

## Example Questions

### Easy (x2, x5, x10)
- "What is 3 x 2? Think: 3 groups of 2."
- "If you have 5 packs of stickers with 5 in each, how many stickers total?"

### Medium (x3, x4, x6)
- "A tricycle has 3 wheels. How many wheels do 6 tricycles have?"
- "You eat 4 cookies every day for a week. How many is that?"

### Hard (x7, x8, x9, word problems)
- "A week has 7 days. How many days in 8 weeks?"
- "9 friends each bring 6 snacks to a party. How many snacks altogether?"

## Common Misconceptions
- Confusing multiplication with addition: "3 x 4 = 7" — redirect: "x means groups of, not plus"
- Order confusion: show that 3 x 4 = 4 x 3 (commutative property) using arrays
- Skipping numbers in sequence: practice skip counting patterns first
