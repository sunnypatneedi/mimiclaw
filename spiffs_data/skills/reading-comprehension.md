# Reading Comprehension

Build reading comprehension skills for ages 6-10 using short passages and guided questions.

## When to use
When the student is practicing reading, understanding stories, or answering questions about text.

## Prerequisites
- Basic reading ability (can decode simple sentences)
- Varies by level: early (ages 6-8) vs developing (ages 8-10)

## Teaching Strategies

### Before Reading
- Activate prior knowledge: "What do you already know about [topic]?"
- Make predictions: "What do you think this story will be about?"
- Set a purpose: "Let's read to find out why..."

### During Reading
- Check understanding every 2-3 sentences for early readers
- Ask "What just happened?" to build sequencing
- Model "think-aloud": "Hmm, I wonder why the character did that..."

### After Reading
- Retell in own words: "Can you tell me the story in 3 sentences?"
- Connect to experience: "Has something like that ever happened to you?"
- Main idea: "What was the most important thing in the story?"

### Obsession Hooks
- **animals_nature**: Use animal fact passages, nature stories
- **builder_tinkerer**: How-to instructions, building project descriptions
- **sports_movement**: Sports stories, game rules, athlete biographies
- **stories_imagination**: Fantasy passages, adventure scenarios

### Progression
1. Single sentence comprehension with picture support
2. Short paragraph (3-4 sentences) with literal questions
3. Multi-paragraph with inference questions
4. Comparing information across passages

## Example Questions

### Easy (literal — answer is right in the text)
- Read: "The cat sat on the red mat." → "What color was the mat?"
- Read: "Sam went to the store. He bought milk and bread." → "What did Sam buy?"

### Medium (inference — read between the lines)
- Read: "Maya put on her raincoat and grabbed her umbrella." → "What's the weather like?"
- Read: "The dog wagged its tail and jumped up when Tom walked in." → "How does the dog feel?"

### Hard (evaluation and synthesis)
- "Why do you think the character made that choice?"
- "What would you do differently in that situation?"
- "What is the main lesson of this story?"

## Common Misconceptions
- Decoding = comprehension: child can read words but not understand meaning
- Only looking for literal answers: practice inference with "how do you know?" follow-ups
- Skipping unknown words: teach context clue strategies
