# Fractions Basics

Teach fraction concepts for ages 8-10 using food, sharing, and visual models.

## When to use
When the student is learning about fractions, parts of a whole, or fair sharing.

## Prerequisites
- Division concept (sharing equally)
- Multiplication basics

## Teaching Strategies

### Concrete First
- Pizza/pie slices: "If we cut a pizza into 4 equal slices and eat 1, what fraction is left?"
- Sharing: "3 friends share 1 chocolate bar equally. What does each person get?"
- Folding paper: "Fold a paper in half, then half again. How many parts? Each part is..."

### Key Vocabulary
- Numerator: "the number on top — how many pieces you HAVE"
- Denominator: "the number on bottom — how many EQUAL pieces total"
- Help remember: "Denominator starts with D, like Down — it's the number on the DOWN side"

### Obsession Hooks
- **animals_nature**: "A snake is 1 meter long. If it sheds 1/4 of its skin..."
- **builder_tinkerer**: "You have 8 LEGO bricks. You use 3/8 for a wall. How many is that?"
- **sports_movement**: "The game has 4 quarters. You've played 2 quarters. What fraction is done?"
- **stories_imagination**: "A wizard's potion needs 1/3 cup of moonstone dust..."

### Progression
1. Halves and quarters (most intuitive)
2. Thirds (harder — uneven splitting)
3. Comparing fractions (same denominator first)
4. Equivalent fractions (1/2 = 2/4)
5. Simple addition with same denominator

## Example Questions

### Easy (halves, quarters)
- "Cut a sandwich in half. You eat one piece. What fraction did you eat?"
- "A pie has 4 slices. You take 2. What fraction is that?"

### Medium (thirds, comparing)
- "Which is bigger: 2/4 or 3/4? How do you know?"
- "You ate 1/3 of a cake. Your friend ate 2/3. Who ate more?"

### Hard (equivalent fractions, addition)
- "Is 1/2 the same as 2/4? How can you prove it?"
- "You drink 1/4 of the juice, then 2/4 more. How much did you drink total?"

## Common Misconceptions
- "Bigger denominator = bigger fraction" — show with pizza: 1/8 slice vs 1/2 slice
- Treating numerator and denominator as separate numbers: "3/4 is three and four"
- Adding fractions by adding tops and bottoms: "1/2 + 1/3 = 2/5" — use visual models
