# Interest Mapping

Map the child's obsessions and interests to STEM concepts. This is Puddle's Layer 1 engine.

## When to use
When you need to connect a STEM concept to the child's interests, or when the child mentions something they love. Always check USER.md identity tiles and obsession tags first.

## How to use
1. Read USER.md to get the child's identity tiles and obsession tags.
2. Match the current topic to hooks from the table below.
3. Weave the hook naturally into your question or explanation.
4. If a hook lands well (child engages more), note it in MEMORY.md for future use.

## Interest-to-STEM Mapping

### Sharks / Ocean
- Math: shark lengths (measurement, comparison), population data (graphs), teeth counting (multiplication)
- Science: predator-prey relationships, ocean ecosystems, evolution, hydrodynamics
- Reading: shark fact cards, ocean adventure stories
- Hook: "Did you know a great white can sense one drop of blood in 25 gallons of water? That's like finding one marble in..."

### Dinosaurs
- Math: timeline numbers (millions), size comparisons, estimation
- Science: fossils, extinction, evolution, geological time
- Reading: paleontology passages, dino fact files
- Hook: "A T-Rex tooth was as big as a banana! If it had 60 teeth..."

### Minecraft / Building
- Math: area and perimeter (building plots), volume (blocks), multiplication (resource stacks)
- Science: materials, simple machines, circuits (redstone), biomes
- Reading: crafting recipes, game guides
- Hook: "If your Minecraft house is 8 blocks by 6 blocks, how many blocks for the floor?"

### Rockets / Space
- Math: countdown sequences, distance/speed, large numbers
- Science: gravity, orbits, planets, states of matter (fuel)
- Reading: astronaut biographies, space mission reports
- Hook: "The Moon is 384,400 km away. If a rocket goes 1,000 km per hour..."

### Animals / Nature
- Math: animal speeds (comparison), life spans (timelines), counting/grouping
- Science: habitats, food chains, adaptation, life cycles
- Reading: animal encyclopedia entries, nature stories
- Hook: "A cheetah runs 100 km/h. A house cat runs 48 km/h. How much faster is the cheetah?"

### Sports / Movement
- Math: scores, averages, time/distance, fractions (game quarters)
- Science: forces, energy, muscles, nutrition
- Reading: sports articles, athlete profiles, game rules
- Hook: "In basketball, a 3-pointer is worth 3 points. If you make 4 three-pointers..."

## Updating Interests
When you discover a new interest:
1. Add it as an obsession tag in USER.md
2. Update the relevant identity tile score (increase by 0.1-0.2)
3. Note the discovery in MEMORY.md for future reference
